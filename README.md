Honey Sting/Stang (Elevator Pitch) ‚ù•
People are often frustrated by the effort it takes to express their voice in a free and safe zone where they can be heard. Our App eliminates the feeling of being imprisoned without a voice. For years, people have trusted society to safe guard freedom of expression however time and time again they have found themselves.. their.. voice restricted. With voiceS, you can express yourself freely and bring about creative freedom on a platform that not only values your voice but broadcasts it, with the power of community.

A full stack application safe and free platform to share and express your voice as an artist, poet, musician but most of all a human being in these troubled times where self-expression and feeling human has gotten lost in translation.

## Favorite code snippets
- The group chose this code as our favorite code because from constant breaking and learning as we went along from each group member and getting help from GA staff that the process gave us so much understanding on what was happening. from the beggining of creating the postroute and have to find it the route and referenceing post route to be connected with comments and having the id connected with the current user. 
```js
// comments.js in backend
router.post('/:postId/new', (req,res)=>{
    console.log(req.body)
    // going into post and finding the post id
    db.Post.findOne({
        _id: req.body.post._id
    })
    .then(post =>{
        // console logging whats inside the post to get info we need
        console.log(post)
        // comments is associated with post and inside the post schema has comments attributed as an array. and pushing those comments in. only need the content and user from comments
            post.comments.push({
            content: req.body.content,
            user: req.body.user.id
        })
        // saving the post
        post.save()
        .then(post =>{
            // getting the info back as a json 
            res.json({post, user: req.body.user})
            console.log(post)
        })

    })
})
```

## Most hated code. 
- This code took the longest to figure out because we had trouble figuring out why it was breaking. first we thought it was the axios.post being wrong. then we thought the console.log showed props as defined but user was not defiend.  when adding comments then the problem after getting comments to render on the web page that it wasnt attached to the user. switched user on the back from _id to .id and that manage to fix who the comment belongs too. didnt redirect as perfect as planned but managed to get the page to reload then redirect to the community page. Doesnt end there, Once Rome Bell stayed with the group for so long helping with the code. we All merged code and after merge more things started breaking down. and then went to TA session to get help from the Erik Heikkila to get the code back on track to get pushed back to the whole team.
```js
 const handleSubmit = (e) =>{
        e.preventDefault()
        console.log(props)
        const comment = {user: props.user, content, post: props.post}
        axios.post(`${REACT_APP_SERVER_URL}/api/comments/${props.post._id}/new`, comment)
        .then(response => {
            console.log(response.data);
            setRedirect(true)
        //    console.log(redirect) 
            window.location.reload(false)
        })
        
    }   js
```
